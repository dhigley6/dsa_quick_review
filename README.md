Quick review of Data Structures and Algorithms

## About

I'm using this README for two things: 1. A way for me to periodically review data structures and algorithms, 2. A checklist of sorts for my current understanding of data structures and algorithms. If I don't feel fluent with a particular topic in reviewing it, then I know to spend more time reviewing it. A third purpose of this for myself is to solidify my understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms by making this document. This could be useful for others seeking either of these same uses. This is going to describe things quickly without a pedagogical foucs. If one is interested in learning parts of Data Structures and Algorithms without significant prior exposure, then I recommend the book "Data Structures and Algorithms in Python" by Goodrich, Tamassia and Goldwasser and the set of Leetcode problems organized by Neetcode and his associated solution videos (https://neetcode.io/roadmap). I've also found this video on Dynamic Programming helpful https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBt53YbR9Kk. 

This is currently a work in progress and may be a bit rough.

## Algorithm Analysis

## Data Structures

### 1. Array

### 2. Linked List

### 3. Stack and Queue

A stack is a collection of 

### 4. Hashmap

### 5. Tree

### 6. Trie

### 7. Heap

### 8. Graph

## Algorithms

### 1. Sorting

#### 1.a. Merge Sort

Basic idea: 

#### 1.b. Quick Sort

#### 1.c. Sorting in Python

In Python, you can use the list.sort method to sort lists in place or the sorted function, which returns a list of sorted elements of the iterable passed to it.

### 2. Recursion

### 3. Two Pointers

Basic idea: 

### 4. Sliding Window

### 5. Backtracking

### 6. Dynamic Programming

### 7. Greedy Algorithms

### 8. Pattern Matching

### 9. Bit Manipulation
